RAFFLE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION
THE FUND GALLERY (www.thefundgallery.org)
Artist Support Raffle Framework
Version 1.0

PURPOSE
This document defines the operational, behavioral, and risk-management protocol for running a threshold-based art raffle on TheFundGallery.org. The primary objective is to raise funds to support emerging artists (e.g., Ferdinand Ssekyanja) while protecting the artist, the gallery, and participants from financial loss or unfair outcomes.

This protocol is designed to guide implementation in VS Code for website development, ticket sales, raffle logic, and promotional content.

--------------------------------------------------
CORE CONCEPT
--------------------------------------------------
This raffle operates on a CONDITIONAL THRESHOLD MODEL.

• Participants purchase low-cost raffle tickets.
• A minimum number of tickets (the “Threshold”) must be sold for the artwork to be awarded.
• A winner is ALWAYS selected.
• If the threshold is not met, the artwork is retained and the winner receives a cash prize instead.

This ensures:
- No-loss protection for the artist
- Guaranteed outcome for participants
- Transparency and trust for the public

--------------------------------------------------
